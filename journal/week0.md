# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### 1.Recreated the Logical archtectural Diagram

I recreated the Logical diagram using Lucid charts with the help of aws icons found in the library.

And I added new library to import  the serverless caching image.

This is the link to [lucid chart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/8086e14d-aebb-45e7-a88b-ccb35bddc8f7/edit?invitationId=inv_00fa8f1e-24f7-4127-8dcb-fc858bc7d102&page=0_0#)

#### 2. Creating Budget 

I created two different budgets , one is for credits to $1 , with threshold  set to 85% for notification purpose

and if exceeded I can then take some decisions and

The second one ,is for the set amount to be used apart from those, gained due to the  aws credits ,Equal to $50 and enabled threshold to 85%.

###### 4. Created AWS CLI

I was not able to Intall aws cli using vs code due to the browser issues , but I Tried to Install it using 

the local environment .

And I tried to type there some AWS cli commands to see if it has installed successfully.

I installed aws cli Version 2 and I followed the steps as it appears on the [AWS Command Line Interface page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

I tried the following command
```
aws sts get-caller-identity  : to see my credentials

```
